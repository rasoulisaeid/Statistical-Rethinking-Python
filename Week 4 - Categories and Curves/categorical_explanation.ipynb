This temperature-based sex determination also indirectly influences other traits like body weight, as temperature affects the ecology and availability of food.\n",

    "# Understanding Differences in Mean Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference in mean weights between two categories (e.g., men and women), we analyze their posterior distributions. The key is to compute the contrast, which is the difference between the means of the two categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Posterior Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Posterior distributions** represent our updated beliefs about the parameters (mean weights) after incorporating observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing the Contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the difference in mean weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulate from Posterior Distributions**:\n",
    "   - Draw samples from the posterior distributions of the mean weights for both categories.\n",
    "   - Calculate the difference in means for each pair of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assessing Overlap and Difference**:\n",
    "   - Even if individual weight distributions overlap, it does not mean the means are the same.\n",
    "   - The key is the distribution of the differences in means, not the overlap of individual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image16.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /> <img src=\"images/image17.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Significance of the Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlap of Distributions**:\n",
    "  - Overlap in individual distributions does not imply a lack of difference in means.\n",
    "  - The posterior distribution of the differences provides a reliable estimate of whether the means are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Differences**:\n",
    "   - The computed contrast provides a range for the difference in mean weights between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-Life Context**:\n",
    "   - Despite overlaps in individual weights, the difference in means can be statistically significant and practically meaningful.\n",
    "   - For example, it can indicate the probability that a randomly selected individual from one category weighs more than one from another category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overlap in individual distributions does not negate a statistically significant difference between means. The contrast (difference in posterior distributions) is crucial for understanding and quantifying the differences between categories. Always compute and interpret this contrast to make informed decisions."

This indicates that the observed weight disparity between men and women can be primarily attributed to differences in height. Interestingly, as height increases, women tend to surpass men slightly in average height. So, we can conclude that **almost all of the causal effect of sex is through height.**\n",
