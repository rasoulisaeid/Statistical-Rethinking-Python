    "### 1. Polynomial Functions\n",
    "- **Approach**: Using polynomial functions to introduce curvature.\n",

    "## Characteristics of Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Polynomials are functions constructed by multiplying a variable (typically denoted as x) by itself multiple times, creating curves of various shapes.\n",
    "- **Structure**: A polynomial consists of terms such as the intercept, a linear term (\\( \\beta_1 x_i \\)), and higher-order terms like \\( \\beta_2 x_i^2 \\).\n",
    "- **Linearity**: Despite their name, polynomials are still considered linear models because they are additive functions of their parameters (\\( \\beta \\) coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image34.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues with Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Symmetry**: Polynomials exhibit unwanted symmetries (e.g., parabolas are perfectly symmetric), which may not align with realistic scientific assumptions.\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Handling**: They result in high uncertainty at the edges of data, leading to unpredictable model behavior.\n",
    "- **Global Influence**: Polynomials determine the shape of the curve based on the entire range of the x-axis, not locally. This lack of local smoothing can distort the model's fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian Perspective on Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Posterior Distribution**: Bayesian updating of polynomial models shows how prior assumptions affect the shape of the curve, often unrealistically assuming symmetry and global influence.\n",
    "- **Data Influence**: Each data point can significantly alter the shape of the polynomial curve across the entire x-axis, which is undesirable for accurate modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Despite their flexibility in fitting various data shapes, polynomials make assumptions that are often unrealistic and do not reflect local data behavior.\n",
    "- **Alternative Approaches**: Techniques like splines provide local smoothing and are more suitable for modeling nonlinear relationships in a scientifically rigorous manner.\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Avoid relying solely on polynomials for complex data modeling tasks due to their inherent limitations and problematic assumptions.\n",

    "## Introduction to Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Utility**: Splines are highly useful for creating locally inferred functions without extensive scientific background information. They help in stratifying data by a continuously varying prediction variable.\n",
    "- **Types**: The simplest to explain are basis splines (B-splines), but various types exist. All work by adding together locally trained terms, resulting in a smooth continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image37.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mechanism of Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Drafting Origin**: The term \"spline\" comes from drafting, where a flexible bar is bent using weights to create smooth curves. Similarly, in statistical splines, anchor points or control points guide the curve's shape.\n",
    "- **Local Training**: Parameters are trained on local data regions, and these local regions are smoothed together to form a continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Cherry Blossom Blooms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Historical Data**: Example data includes the day of the first cherry blossom bloom recorded over 1,000 years in a specific region of Japan.\n",
    "- **Spline Fitting**: Splines can help visualize trends in such data, showing reliable local variations (hills and valleys) without prior scientific assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image38.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mechanism of B-Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Model with Additive Terms**: B-splines are linear models with a series of additive terms, where synthetic variables (basis functions) represent local positions.\n",
    "- **Weight Parameters**: Each term has a weight parameter (\\( W \\)) that adjusts the importance of the corresponding basis function (\\( B \\)).\n",
    "- **Local Influence**: Each weight affects the curve only in the region where its basis function is non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image39.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualizing Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basis Functions**: Colored curves represent basis functions, and their values at any point form the basis of the spline.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image40.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight Adjustment**: Changing the weight of a basis function adjusts the spline locally. For example:\n",
    "  - Weighting \\( W_1 \\) affects only basis function 1, influencing the curve on the far left.\n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src=\"images/image41.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Weighting \\( W_2 \\) affects basis function 2, impacting the middle left region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image42.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Weighting \\( W_3 \\) affects basis function 3, modifying the middle right region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image43.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Weighting \\( W_4 \\) affects basis function 4, altering the far right region.\n",

    "- **Infinite Shapes**: Splines can take an infinite number of shapes, providing flexibility in modeling various data trends.\n",
    "- **Local vs. Global**: Unlike polynomials, splines adjust based on local data, offering more reliable and interpretable models.\n",

    "## Example of Splines in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Height and Age Data**: We model the relationship between age and height using splines. Though age is considered a causal influence on height, it's important to note that:\n",
    "  - **Age as a Cause**: Age itself cannot be experimentally manipulated. It's a proxy for time, during which various growth-related causes accumulate.\n",
    "  - **Proxy Utility**: Despite not being a direct cause, age is useful in modeling growth patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian Spline Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Training**: Start with a Bayesian spline model trained on data from 10 individuals. \n",
    "  - **Wiggly Curves**: Initially, the spline curve is very wiggly, especially outside the data range, reflecting high uncertainty.\n",
    "  - **Learning Path**: As more data points are added, the spline learns the expected growth path, smoothing locally without the wild fluctuations seen in polynomial models.\n",
    "- **Biological Realism**: Unlike a biological model, the spline doesn't inherently prevent unrealistic decreases in height. It adjusts based on data without biological constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "<video controls width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"files/recording3.mp4\" title=\"Animation\"></video>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basis Functions and Weight Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basis Functions**: These are underlying hills that form the spline. The heights of these hills are adjusted by weight parameters.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: The black hills represent basis functions, and their sum at any vertical point on the x-axis forms the spline curve (blue).\n",
    "  - **Local Adjustment**: The spline is the sum of these locally adjusted basis functions, ensuring a smooth, flexible curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Splines vs. Biological Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages of Splines**: Splines are highly flexible and can fit a variety of data shapes without requiring strong prior knowledge. They are additive and linear underneath, making them useful in many applied statistics scenarios.\n",
    "- **Limitations in Biological Contexts**: For modeling human height, splines may not be ideal. Biological models, which consider distinct growth phases, provide more accurate and meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<video controls width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"files/recording4.mp4\" title=\"Animation\"></video>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Strategy: Modeling Growth Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Growth Phases**: Humans undergo distinct biologically controlled growth phases:\n",
    "  - **Infancy**: Rapid overall growth.\n",
    "  - **Childhood**: Slower body growth, rapid head growth.\n",
    "  - **Puberty**: Body growth catches up with head growth; brain growth essentially stops.\n",
    "  - **Adulthood**: Growth levels off, with a slight decline in stature over time due to gravity.\n",
    "- **Phase-Specific Models**: Each phase can be modeled with parameters reflecting biological realities:\n",
    "  - **Infancy and Childhood**: Parameters for rapid and slower growth rates.\n",
    "  - **Puberty**: Parameters for body catch-up growth.\n",
    "  - **Adulthood**: Parameters for the leveling off and slight decline in height.\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Using phase-specific models with biologically meaningful constraints allows for more accurate modeling and meaningful comparisons between different growth phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image46.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Splines Wisely**: While splines are powerful tools for many applications, in contexts with strong underlying biological processes, models that incorporate these processes are preferable.\n",
    "- **Flexible Modeling**: Splines remain an essential tool in the absence of strong generative models, providing flexible and locally adaptive curve fitting."
